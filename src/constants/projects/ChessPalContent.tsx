			<h6>Overview:</h6>
			<p>
				This case study focuses on the implementation of the user
				interface (UI) for ChessPal, a chess application built with
				React. The application aims to provide chess enthusiasts with a
				platform for chess preparation and analysis. It incorporates an
				authentication system and features move highlighting based on
				popularity. The UI implementation will utilize technologies such
				as React, TypeScript, Sass, and Redux.
			</p>
			<h6>Challenges:</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>
					User Authentication: Implementing an authentication system
					using React, Redux, and backend APIs to allow users to
					register, log in securely, and protect their personal
					information.
				</li>
				<li>
					Chess Board Visualization: Designing a visually appealing
					and responsive chess board UI using React components, which
					can handle user interactions and render chess pieces
					dynamically.
				</li>
				<li>
					Move Highlighting: Developing algorithms to analyze chess
					moves and highlight them based on their popularity or
					relevance. Creating UI components that visually indicate
					popular moves to aid chess preparation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Multiplayer System: Implementing a real-time multiplayer
					system using React and Redux to enable users to play chess
					games against other online players. Managing game states,
					turn-based moves, and clock functionality.
				</li>
				<li>
					Integration with Backend APIs: Connecting the frontend UI
					with backend APIs to fetch chess data, move analysis,
					user-specific information, and handle multiplayer game
					sessions.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h6>Solution:</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>
					User Authentication: Implementing React components and Redux
					actions to handle user registration, login, and secure token
					management. Utilizing backend APIs to authenticate user
					credentials and securely store sensitive information.
				</li>
				<li>
					Chess Board Visualization: Using ChessboardJs library for
					the ui chessboard, but also creating a game-tree data
					structure for the game state handling. Utilizing Sass for
					styling and responsive design to ensure optimal user
					experience on different devices.
				</li>
				<li>
					Move Highlighting: Developing algorithms to analyze move
					popularity based on historical game data or engine analysis.
					Implementing React components that highlight popular moves
					or suggest optimal moves during chess analysis. Using Redux
					to manage the state of move highlighting.
				</li>
				<li>
					Multiplayer System: Implementing real-time communication
					using (SSE) Server-sent events to enable multiplayer chess
					games. Managing game states, turn-based moves, and clock
					functionality using Redux to synchronize game states across
					clients.
				</li>
				<li>
					Integration with Backend APIs: Establishing API connections
					using Redux middleware to fetch chess data, move analysis,
					user-specific information, and handle multiplayer game
					sessions. Utilizing TypeScript to ensure type safety and
					maintain a well-structured codebase.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h6>Result:</h6>
			<p>
				The result is a fully implemented UI for the ChessPal
				application built with React, incorporating an authentication
				system, move highlighting based on popularity, and a multiplayer
				system. Users can register, log in securely, and protect their
				personal information. The application provides a visually
				appealing and responsive chess board UI that allows users to
				make moves intuitively. Move highlighting based on popularity
				aids in chess preparation and analysis. Users can play chess
				games against other online players in real-time, managing game
				states, turn-based moves, and clock functionality. The
				application integrates with backend APIs to fetch chess data,
				move analysis, user-specific information, and handle multiplayer
				game sessions. The UI implementation utilizes React, TypeScript,
				Sass for styling, and Redux for state management, providing a
				robust and efficient development experience.
